I did it I was able to get the results for curl requesting and server usage. 
Learned alot more about git than API's truthfully but it was ana overall good learning experience. 
There was at one point in the instructions I did not realize I had to open another gitBash window
But with some help from my TA and some google searching I was able to ssuccessfull run the hw and lab. 

It was tiring and a long journey but I was able to make it ! Thank you.
